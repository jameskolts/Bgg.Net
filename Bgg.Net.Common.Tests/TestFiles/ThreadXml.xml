			<body>A quick, light rummy-variant for two-4 players. Rating 6.5
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a special deck of cards containing six &quot;suits&quot; and various special purpose cards. You cannot play this with a standard deck.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;As with all rummy-variants, the games is a draw-play-discard sequence with the player having the option of drawing the top card from either the discard or draw piles. When any player discards his final card, the hand ends and points are tallied, with cards in hand potentially counting against the player's score.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;I've always enjoyed rummy variants and this is a good one. I have never felt that rummy is &quot;deep&quot;, so any rummy game will never achieve a &quot;7&quot; rating in my book, but this is as good as they come, with lots of options for skillful play to overcome bad draws.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;The theme is the case of Jack the Ripper and each suit represents a possible suspect. The cards on the table of each suit at the end of a hand correspond to evidence against that suspect. The suspect with the most evidence at the end of the hand is presumed guilty and the value of evidence against that suspect is doubled. This gives the players incentive to control who the guilty player is. There are lots of special purpose cards to allow extra draws and searches through the discard pile.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;Also, one special card allows the Ripper to &quot;escape&quot; meaning that the case goes unsolved (as it did in real life). The card must be played in conjunction with other cards so it is not all that easy to do, but it means that everyone has to be alert to the possibility. The situation is similar to &quot;shooting the moon&quot; in hearts but easier to accomplish, especially with less-experienced players.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;Overall a fun game, but if you don't like rummy, leave it alone. It is quick, but not deep. Game time is 30-40 minutes.

				&lt;br/&gt;I hear this is a highly complex and long game. Am rather interested in getting this game for my collection. Assuming from the people I know that they never played, if this game were to put on the table for a group of players that never played this before, how hard would it be to understand the rules and the game mechanics?

				&lt;br/&gt;The game is complex, but very playable. My advice is to print out all the player aids, familiarize yourself with them, then give yourself almost an hour to go through the mechanisms of the game with the players.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;That's how I did it. Had a great 1st game with 5 newbies.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy.

				I think it takes one complete game to grasp. I've taught it to many people, ususally advising that they shouldn't expect to do well first time around. Most agreed afterwards that it was time well invested.

				I played for the first time last night.  I think that with the player aids (which could use revising, BTW) and five players that are even moderately familiar with the game, it can be played easily in 3 hours.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;I don't think it takes a whole game to &quot;get it.&quot;  It only took me half of a game to realize just what I had done to screw it up. &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;

				&lt;br/&gt;I don't think you can play a 5 player game of Die Macher in 3 hours.  Maybe in 4 hours, but even that seems a stretch to me.  We play maybe twice a year, with maybe one newbie each time, and it takes a good 5-6 hours to play.
