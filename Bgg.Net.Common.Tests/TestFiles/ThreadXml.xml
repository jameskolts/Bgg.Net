			<body>A quick, light rummy-variant for two-4 players. Rating 6.5
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a special deck of cards containing six &quot;suits&quot; and various special purpose cards. You cannot play this with a standard deck.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;As with all rummy-variants, the games is a draw-play-discard sequence with the player having the option of drawing the top card from either the discard or draw piles. When any player discards his final card, the hand ends and points are tallied, with cards in hand potentially counting against the player's score.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;I've always enjoyed rummy variants and this is a good one. I have never felt that rummy is &quot;deep&quot;, so any rummy game will never achieve a &quot;7&quot; rating in my book, but this is as good as they come, with lots of options for skillful play to overcome bad draws.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;The theme is the case of Jack the Ripper and each suit represents a possible suspect. The cards on the table of each suit at the end of a hand correspond to evidence against that suspect. The suspect with the most evidence at the end of the hand is presumed guilty and the value of evidence against that suspect is doubled. This gives the players incentive to control who the guilty player is. There are lots of special purpose cards to allow extra draws and searches through the discard pile.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;Also, one special card allows the Ripper to &quot;escape&quot; meaning that the case goes unsolved (as it did in real life). The card must be played in conjunction with other cards so it is not all that easy to do, but it means that everyone has to be alert to the possibility. The situation is similar to &quot;shooting the moon&quot; in hearts but easier to accomplish, especially with less-experienced players.
				&lt;br/&gt;
				&lt;br/&gt;Overall a fun game, but if you don't like rummy, leave it alone. It is quick, but not deep. Game time is 30-40 minutes.
