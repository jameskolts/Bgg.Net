		<description>Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

			<comment username=".JcK." rating="9" value="Die Macher is one of the very few long games that I&apos;d like to play on any given opportunity, and I was hugely impressed by its design since my first play. It&apos;s long, but it&apos;s complex, not complicated: there are different rule systems mixed together to portray different aspects of your political campaign, but each of them is simple to understand and to manipulate during the game. 
Mastering the whole system takes time, of course, but you&apos;ll find yourself grasping its main dynamics much sooner than you&apos;d expect, probably just after you&apos;ve gone through the first round of play. So, don&apos;t let its fame scare you: our first game was with two non-gamers, and they both really enjoyed it. The system is streamlined and functional, the theme is well implemented and you can easily imagine your party going through all the vicissitudes of a political campaign. 
Give it a try if you can :)" />
			<comment username="100pcBlade" rating="6" value="Very good deep strategy game but while I don&apos;t mind games of this length, they need have a little less repetitiveness for them to really shine. And the Valley Games implementation is really poor with their choice of card icons which are far too similar. (I also own the original 4p version)" />
			<comment username="143245" rating="5" value="Die Macher as a game that is over 30 years old and still played is an example of another time in gaming. Today, the game lacks a certain pizzazz that newer heavy euros have (not just in theme, but mechanical implementation) and it&apos;s more difficult to hold the attention of players. I can see where those who put in the effort to look past the points where modern gamers would say &quot;this really should be streamlined&quot; and study of the design will be rewarded.

In some ways, it&apos;s a game that falls into the same category as Virgin Queen/HiS and the COIN series; long, hulking, beautiful monstrosities that require a full player count to shine. Bonus points if they are all experienced folks. People have to rearrange their lives and schedules to make these sorts of games happen. Die Macher is a wonderful convention game, provided people have agree on a rule set... Unfortunately, that boat seems to have sailed, and the 4th edition is also unlikely to resolve that. That&apos;s not necessarily bad, just an annoyance.

This is an experience, one of those games that was revolutionary at it&apos;s time, and I encourage people to give it a shot. I&apos;d like to sit and tinker with it, to explore how the interlocking pieces and parts all fit together, but at what cost? Do I need a copy on hand? I doubt it, possibly just nearby. Every now and then I think about it, even if it took years to get it to the table, and I&apos;m unsure when I&apos;ll see it played again...

edit: The more I fiddle with and talk about the game with others, the more I find that it&apos;s just undercooked, and you have to cobble together an agreeable ruleset in order to get it to really sing. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s worth my time anymore." />

			<comment username="3greyhounds" rating="7.5" value="Awesome game.  I enjoy playing, the only caveat being the length, so I can&apos;t always agree to play it, but I&apos;d like to play more often." />
			<comment username="4Corners" rating="6" value="Great theme, very involved and engrossing game, BUT has some significantly flawed random elements to the game (opinion polls, secret auction for first player).  Also, although this needs more than 1 play to really appreciate/properly rate this game, how likely is it that you&apos;re going to get at least 3 people to sit down for another 6-8 hour game again (especially if someone got burned by the randomness of the game the first time)?  Unfortunately, this game will probably be forever retired after 1 play." />

I like the game. But it wasn&apos;t as heavy as I expected (sadly). Some luck factor, not large but still significant (especially when it comes to polls). But more depends on interactions between players.

This is somewhat strange as the game is way to long for a light, heavy interaction, party game. And yet I didn&apos;t feel I had enough influence on the game progress to call it a Diplomacy-kind of game.

But I played it only once and we didn&apos;t do much negotiations (sadly)." />
			<comment username="adamredwoods" rating="6" value="1 play / 4 players

LIKE: I liked how players could build up votes in another area while attempting to conduct manipulation in another. This created some interesting aspects in timing, and when to spend money. The rules for the short game were not too complicated. The theme is unique.

DISLIKE: The cards created a very luck-oriented feel to the game. I think not allowing a card flush would help with this. There are also some random take-that cards in the poll deck, which felt out of place. I feel some other mechanism could have been used.

OVERALL: Not a bad game, but the random elements made the game results seem lopsided. For that much of a time investment, we might be better playing something else. I saw a variant in the BGG forums for mixing in first edition rules, may be worth a look.

Some similarities to El Grande, but El Grande is so much better." />
			<comment username="adamw" rating="8.5" value="I&apos;ve played it. It took 5 hours for 5 of us to march through the game. I really liked it. It never felt slow or bogged down. There&apos;s not much room for AP ever in the game. But it is the same game played basically 6 times in a row. Each state is resolved as you peer ahead to the next 3 coming up. At times, you start getting plans laid out and other times, you find you made a mistake. The random &apos;poll&apos; cards are harsh and scary and frankly, I love &apos;em. They add spice to an otherwise nearly precise mathematical experience (something I generally do not like in a game). I like the dodge and match game with your platforms vs. opponents vs. the state vs. the national end game. There&apos;s really nothing else like the granddaddy of heavy Euros. And there likely never will be. Very fun." />

A complex game for true gamers. Very rewarding for those who are willing to invest the time to learn the secrets of Die Macher.

The biggest minus comes from the rather big luck factor for such a long game. Losing a 4 hour game in the last minute just because of bad luck can be quite frustrating.

2016-03-08
It is remarkable how well Die Macher has stood the test of time. Considering the fact that the game was designed back in the mid 80&apos;s, it is still very relevant. Of course, you have to admit that the game is not as visually pleasing as you would expect today. It almost looks like a prototype. After a while the table also starts to look very busy.

Once you get past the game&apos;s age and looks, you have a solid but heavy strategy game in your hands. Each turn has many steps and is rather complex. There are a lot of things to keep an eye on. Fortunately, there is a fair amount of fluctuation of luck which helps in maintaining the flow of the game. If the Die Macher was purely deterministic, would it surely suffer from too much analysis. Now, since you cannot calculate everything, you can come up with sensible moves within a reasonable amount of time. Of course, very tight games can be decided by chance but usually it is the best player who wins.

Die Macher is definitely not the beast its reputation suggests. There are far heavier and more difficult games out there. Yes, the game is long but you do not need the whole day. A game can be finished in an evening." />

It has to be said that it&apos;s pretty dry and involved, but I felt early on that I had a bit of an idea what I was doing.  For a deep game, there is still quite a lot of luck in it, but I think you can mitigate against most of it if you&apos;re careful." />

My favourite game to show non-gamers to scare them!
Even if you are scared of the theme and supposed complexity, give it a chance - I promise you won&apos;t be disappointed.
For a 4 hour game, the rules are very easy to teach, since the game occurs in phases (a la Power Grid) and turns." />

			<comment username="Al Johnson" rating="9" value="Truly an exceptional and fascinating game.  It does have a 2-3 turn learning curve (at least for me it did), but thankfully you are not out of the game at that time.  The theme is excellent and integrates well into the game with the national election carrying significant weight at the end.  There is a lot going on here, and I would classify it as a very meaty game - definitely for experienced gamers only as a game can easily go for more than 5 hours.  Negatives are game length - it&apos;s hard to find people who are willing to sit down for one game this long, and second, fiddly rules.  And because I don&apos;t see this game being played often, constant reference back to the rulebook may be the norm.  Overall though, great game!

(October 2012)

Okay, played Die Macher for a second time, the new edition, in February 2020, and for my tastes in game design, I think there are just too many things about this game that feel randomly decisive.  For example, the polling mechanic, and the platform card array with its &quot;luck of the draw&quot; flips, and the blind bidding for turn order.  In general, I really dislike games where blind bidding plays an overly decisive role in the game, and Die Macher seems to feature this problem.  Bottom line: unfortunately, this game now feels like an &quot;old school&quot; euro design, wherein random events are actually considered a fun feature of the design.  Not a fan.

Only if you understand that, you could ask me for an exact shipping quote before ordering.&amp;#10;   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I'll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)" />

Box shrink removed; otherwise it's like new. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;***** PLEASE READ BELOW, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A NEW BUYER!!! *****&amp;#10;&amp;#10;* The price listed at the top is only for the item itself. Please be aware that there will be extra shipping costs that you, the buyer, are required to pay. I use PirateShip to find the lowest shipping rates between FedEx, UPS and USPS. These shipping costs will vary, but will typically be about $11-13 for a single, average-sized game, using a medium flat rate box when possible. For smaller games, or for those of you living close to the mid-west region of the country, shipping costs will be lower. Shipping of larger games that do not fit in a medium flat rate box will be based on weight and distance, and can sometimes run $20 or more, especially if you live on the east coast. PLEASE ASK FOR A SHIPPING ESTIMATE BEFORE PURCHASING ANYTHING IF YOU ARE UNSURE! *&amp;#10;&amp;#10;** Please make sure your shipping address in the BGG Marketplace and PayPal is correct because this is where I will ship to. If you want anything extra like additional insurance and/or delivery confirmation, etc., please ask! $50 of insurance is already included with any level of Priority mail, but with retail ground, no insurance is included by default. I will not be held responsible for packages after I have mailed them. **&amp;#10;&amp;#10;*** There will be a $0.75 fee added (in the tax section) to every order to help with packing materials for normal/large-sized games (but usually not for small promos) . ***&amp;#10;&amp;#10;**** I will not ship games internationally. It is no longer worth the hassle and risk. Sorry! ****&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you!" />
